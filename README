Open-source Android implementation of the popular board game Blokus. With very smooth Drag & Drop user interface.

A family game involving four players and a board with 20 x 20 squares. Like chess or checkers, it's a game for which at any time you can see your opponent's pieces.

Each player starts with 21 pieces : 1 monomino, 1 domono, 2 triominos, 5 tetraminos and 12 pentaminos. It may recall you the Tetris polyominos...

"For first round, I must place a piece so that it touches one of the corners of the board"

"Next, a piece must be placed so that it touches a corner of one of my own pieces.
It may touch several corners, but never any side/edge of my pieces!" Look at screenshots.

The game has a nice and natural User Interface : just Drag & Drop the piece with the finger. Rotate a piece likewise. And return a piece with a long press.

"If a cannot place any more piece I pass my turn."

The end of the game is reached when every player passes.
"My score is : addition of the squares of the pieces I placed".

Refer to 'Menu > Help' inside the app. With several screenshots.

You can safely quit at any time : your current game will be restored on next startup.


You play against the machine. You can configure the level of corresponding Artificial Intelligence : 4 levels. Refer to Menu > Preferences

You can disable AI for a human play only. Refer to Menu > Preferences.

The software has no unobtrusive banner advertising.
Once installed, you can play off-line.

The game is free. And even more : the code is open-source. 
You can access it at http://github.com/scoutant.
You can reuse and adapt it according to GPL v3 license.
